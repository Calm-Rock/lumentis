## How to use

4. Pick what you like from the generated outline.
5. Wait for your docs to be written up!

## How it works

Lumentis reads your transcript and:
1. Asks you some questions to understand the themes and audience.
2. Generates an outline and asks you to select what you want to keep.
3. Writes up the selected parts of the outline into full pages.
4. Sets up a Next.js docs site with your generated pages that you can host.

Using bun because it's fast. You can also use npm or yarn if you prefer.

I want to add support for more docs/hosting options. Ideas welcome.
The AI chain is a bit janky and expensive, ideas to smooth the flow would be awesome.
CI, tests, all the good stuff. I'm a bit overworked.
